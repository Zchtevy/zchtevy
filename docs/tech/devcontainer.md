> An **integrated development environment (IDE)** is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Some IDEs, [..] contain the necessary compiler, interpreter, or both; others [..] do not.

## Hypothesis

Today most software developers are specialized to either the client side (web or app) or the server side. However, in future this specialization may no longer be possible. Today enterprises simply outsource the complex and expensive challenge to operate physical servers, on.

Today it is more and more common for developers to work on both ends. DevOps for those who are looking for a buzz word.

As a natural consequence, the demand for full stack developers has skyrocketed in the last years and will increase even more in the next decade.

But at the end, those full stack developers are human beeings and they can only reach the excellence level in

## Conclusion

IDE's will slowly be replaced by a more modular set of tools,
